2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups brown sugar, packed
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups rolled oats
2 eggs
2 tablespoons molasses
1 tablespoon milk
1 (12 ounce) pkg semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl, beat together brown sugar and butter until well combined. Add oats, eggs, molasses, and milk and beat well. 

Add dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix until blended.

Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop dough and drop about 3 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
