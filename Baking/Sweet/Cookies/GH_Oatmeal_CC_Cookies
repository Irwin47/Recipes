Ingredients

    1 C butter
    1 C sugar
    1 C brown sugar
    2 well beaten eggs
    1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
    1 C white whole wheat flour
    1/2 C all purpose flour
    1 tsp. salt
    1 tsp. baking soda
    2 1/2 C oatmeal
    1 C chocolate chips

Note - If you double the recipe, use 1 1/2 C butter!

Directions

Cream together the softened butter and sugars. 

Add the eggs and vanilla. 

Next, sift together the flour, baking soda and salt.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ones & mix until well combined. 
	
Stir in the oatmeal â€“ either by hand, or with the mixer. 

Then, add the chocolate chips.  I find these easier to stir in by hand. 

Refrigerate dough for 1 hour, covered.

Then, scoop onto a lightly greased cookie sheet, or baking mat. 

Bake 8-10 minutes at 350, until cookies look slightly browned on the outside edges.  

Allow cookies to sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes and the transfer to a cooling rack. 

Store in an airtight container. 

Makes about 4 dozen with small cookie scoop.
