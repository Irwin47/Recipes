Ingredients

    226 grams butter
    198 grams sugar
    216 grams brown sugar
    2 well beaten eggs
    1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
    113 grams white whole wheat flour
    60 grams all purpose flour
    1.3 grams salt
    6 grams baking soda
    223 grams oatmeal
    ~170 grams chocolate chips

Note - If you double the recipe, use 170 grams butter!

Directions

Cream together the softened butter and sugars. 

Add the eggs and vanilla. 

Next, sift together the flour, baking soda and salt.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ones & mix until well combined. 
	
Stir in the oatmeal â€“ either by hand, or with the mixer. 

Then, add the chocolate chips.  I find these easier to stir in by hand. 

Refrigerate dough for 1 hour, covered.

Then, scoop onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a baking mat. 

Bake 8-10 minutes at 350F, until cookies look slightly browned on the outside edges.  

Allow cookies to sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes and the transfer to a cooling rack. 

Store in an airtight container. 

Makes about 4 dozen with small cookie scoop.

* Pro-Tip: Use a heat-gun to cook the centers if stil underdone when the edges turn golden brown, adjust oven temperature down and bake time up for next batches.
