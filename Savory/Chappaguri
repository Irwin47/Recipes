Ingredients

1 package of Jjapagetti (짜파게티) instant noodles (labelled “Chapagetti” on the package in English)

1 package of Neoguri (너구리) instant noodles

Beef steak, optional

8 ounces rib eye steak or sirloin, cut into ½ inch cubes
  Substitute cheap stir-fry beef

a pinch of kosher salt

a pinch of ground black pepper

1 teaspoon vegetable oil

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Directions

If you use beef steak, combine the beef, kosher salt, pepper, and the vegetable oil in a small pan and mix it well with a wooden spoon.

Cook over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon until the beef turns light brown. Add the butter, stir and mix well and cook another minute. Remove from the heat.

Open both packages and take out the noodles and all the packets from both.

Jjapagetti (labelled “Chapagetti” on the package in English) has noodles with 3 packets: one for black bean paste seasoning powder, one for seasoning oil, and one for vegetable flakes.

Neoguri (너구리) has thicker noodles with 2 packets: one for spicy seasoning powder and one for vegetable flakes.

Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a medium-sized pot. Add both kinds of noodles and both packets of vegetable flakes.

Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and turning with tongs or long chopsticks to separate the noodles and cook them evenly.

Strain the noodles over a medium-sized bowl, and then put the noodles and the cooked flakes back into the pot.

Measure 1 cup of the strained hot noodle water and put it back into the pot. Add black bean paste seasoning powder, and ½ of the spicy seasoning powder from the Neoguri package, and the beef (if used). Stir and mix for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well incorporated.

Remove from the heat, add the seasoning oil and stir it in.

Transfer the noodles to a large plate and serve right away. You can serve with sliced yellow pickled radish (danmuji) or kimchi.
